# Testes automatizados utilizando Cypress 

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

I used versions v18.15.0 and 9.5.0 of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

Run npm install to install the dev dependencies.


Run npm run cy:open to open Cypress in interactive mode.
